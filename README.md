# VN Engine

A visual novel engine that draws inspiration from RenPy and is meant to be a more performant replacement with feature parity.

The engine is now in early stages of development. This `README` will change to reflect updates to this situation.

This repository contains a proof of concept. Cloning it and running `cargo run` in the terminal (assuming you have `cargo` and `rust` installed) will execute the example game in the `assets` folder. As this proof of concept evolves the example will be developed further until it is the equivalent of a production ready RenPy project.
